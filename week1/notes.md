# Week 1 notes

  * Had to wrestle a bit with installing SML on Ubuntu and getting the REPL to work in Emacs. 
  * The [docs](http://www.smlnj.org/dist/working/110.87/INSTALL) are not super user-friendly to say the least.
  * Luckily enough [this gist](https://gist.github.com/tedz2usa/725307535cb4c336941d13e2e5cf86eb) listed all the problems I ran into so I was able to just copy-paste the commands they listed there.
  * Now I have to try to memorize: `C-c C-s <RET>` for opening the repl.
  * I did Homework 0, that was easy enough. Submitted it through Coursera and the auto-grader gave me **100%** for changing one + into a *.
