# Week 1 notes

## Lectures
  * Watched all the videos, some on higher speed. Lecturer is nice and clear. Not too much happening yet but the course contents sound exciting. Didn't take any special notes since it was all very introductory, but focused on installing.
  
## Installation
  * Had to wrestle a bit with installing SML on Ubuntu and getting the REPL to work in Emacs. 
  * The [docs](http://www.smlnj.org/dist/working/110.87/INSTALL) are not super user-friendly to say the least.
  * Luckily enough [this gist](https://gist.github.com/tedz2usa/725307535cb4c336941d13e2e5cf86eb) listed all the problems I ran into so I was able to just copy-paste the commands they listed there.
  * Now I have to try to memorize: `C-c C-s <RET>` for opening the repl.
  
## Homework
  * I did Homework 0, that was easy enough. Submitted it through Coursera and the auto-grader gave me **100%** for changing one + into a *. 
  * Also "peer-reviewed" two random Coursera submissions, that was just a technical exercise but OK.
